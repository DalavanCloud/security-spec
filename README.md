# About

This project hosts JSR-375, the Java EE Security API specification.

# Goals of the JSR

The goal of this specification is to improve the Java EE platform
by ensuring the Security API aspect is useful in the modern cloud/PaaS application paradigm.
This promotes self-contained application portability across all Java EE servers,
and promotes use of modern programming concepts such as expression language
and contexts and dependency injection.
This specification will holistically attempt to simplify, standardize, and modernize
the Security API across the platform in areas identified by the community.

The Java EE Security API specification is on the JCP Ballot as JSR 375, for inclusion in Java EE 8.
The reference implementation (RI) is called Soteria.
